== Usage

=== Enter new rate for a project

There are two ways to set rates for a Member of a Project.

1. Browse to the Project Settings page
2. Select the Members tab
3. Enter the rate for the Member and click the set Rate

Alternatively, Rates can be set in the User Administration panel

1. Browse to the Administration panel
2. Select Users
3. Select the specific user to add a rate for
4. Select the Membership tab and enter a rate for each project
4. Or, select the Rate History and enter a new rate in the form

=== Enter default rate for a user

A default rate is a user's Rate that doesn't correspond to a specific project.  It can be set in the User Administration panel:

1. Browse to the Administration panel
2. Select Users
3. Select the specific user to add a rate for
4. Select the Rate History and enter a new rate in the form, keep the Project field set to Default Rate.

=== Lock a Rate

Currently this feature is only available through the Rate API.  A Rate will become locked once a valid TimeEntry is assigned to the Rate.

=== Caching

The plugin includes some simple caching for time entries cost.
Instead of doing a lookup for each time entry, the rate plugin will cache the total cost for each time entry to the database.
The caching is done transparently but you can run and purge the caches from the Administration Panel or
using the provided rate tasks (rake rate_plugin:cache:update_cost_cache, rake rate_plugin:cache:refresh_cost_cache).
